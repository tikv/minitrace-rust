## FAQ

### Why is minitrace so fast?

There are some articles posted by the maintainer of minitrace:

- [The Design of A High-performance Tracing Library in Rust (Chinese)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTaxC1RcXE)
- [How We Trace a KV Database with Less than 5% Performance Impact](https://en.pingcap.com/blog/how-we-trace-a-kv-database-with-less-than-5-percent-performance-impact/)

### Why / What's the difference compared to 'X'?

Most tracing libraries aims to provide more features, while minitrace always prioritize performance. 

Rather than providing a full-featured tracing library, minitrace is designed to be simple, modular and extensible.
You can easily compose your own tracing features on top of minitrace with minimal effort.

For a practical illustration, refer to `examples/log.rs` to learn how to integrate the widely-used `log` library and
its macros with minitrace in just 10 lines of code.

### Will you support OpenTelemetry feature 'X'?

Minitrace is focused on high performance tracing only. You can open an issue for the missing tracing features you want to have.

Note that we always prioritize performance over features, so that not all tracing feature requests may be accepted. 

### What's the status of this library?

**API Unstable**: The API is not stabilized yet, may be changed in the future. 

**Code base Tested**: Minitrace has been tested with high coverage. However, applications utilizing minitrace have not been widely deployed, so that minitrace is currently **NOT** regarded as battle-tested.
